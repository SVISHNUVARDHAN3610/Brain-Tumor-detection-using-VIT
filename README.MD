# Brain Tumor Classification Using Vision Transformers

## 📌 Project Overview
This project utilizes **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** to classify brain tumors from **MRI scan images**. ViTs outperform traditional CNN-based models by leveraging self-attention mechanisms to extract detailed features, improving classification accuracy.

## Summary

 **Brain Tumor Classification Using Vision Transformers**  

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model using **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** to classify brain tumors from MRI scan images. Unlike traditional CNN-based approaches, ViTs leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in medical images, improving classification accuracy.  

The model was trained on publicly available brain tumor datasets, with extensive preprocessing, including image normalization, augmentation, and resizing. Various hyperparameter tuning techniques were applied to optimize performance. The classification results were evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional deep learning models.
